        "description": "C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language widely used for system/software development and game programming. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and flexibility, making it ideal for applications that require direct hardware access or need to operate in real-time environments.",
        "history": "C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language. C++ introduced object-oriented features while retaining the procedural programming characteristics of C.",

            "Powerful for both system-level and application-level programming, with extensive use in operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance software.",
            "Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms.",
            "Rich standard library with data structures, algorithms, input/output operations, and more."
